Bro Radio is the Vale's local radio station.

We're available on FM in the Vale of Glamorgan, across Cardiff and the Eastern Vale via DAB+ on the Cardiff SSDAB multiplex, and [online](https://broradio.fm)

This GitHub account mostly exists as a way to share our code that we use to maintain odds-and-ends of our broadcast infrastructure.
